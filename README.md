Software Development Files
File sharing for two seperate devices, for a class. Don't Mind me! :)

SETUP
>>cd repo <-- Remember to specify where the git init will place repository for concise file organization within the PC. (also prevents hacking by not allowing remote editing of localized files on ENTIRE pc.)<br>
>>git init<br>
>>git remote add origin (url)<br>
>>git fetch origin<br>
>>git checkout master<br>

TO RECEIVE FILES FROM REMOTE REPOSITORY (GitHub)
$ git fetch <remote> <--- Replace remote with URL of gitRepository.

git remote add origin [URL]
git push -u origin master
